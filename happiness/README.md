# Automated Data Analysis

### Dataset Analysis Report

#### 1. Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of happiness and well-being metrics across different countries and years, encapsulated in 2,363 observations with 10 variables. The primary focus is on the "Life Ladder," which serves as a subjective measure of well-being, and includes economic and social indicators like GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, and perceptions of freedom and corruption. The variables are of mixed types, including categorical (country names, as an object type) and continuous numerical types (most others, as float64 or int64).

**Variables:**
- **Country name (obj)**: Name of the country.
- **Year (int)**: Year of data collection.
- **Life Ladder (float64)**: The subjective rating of life satisfaction.
- **Log GDP per capita (float64)**: Logarithm of GDP per capita.
- **Social support (float64)**: Indicator of social connections and support.
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth (float64)**: Expected healthy years of life at birth.
- **Freedom to make life choices (float64)**: Measure of freedom in life choices.
- **Generosity (float64)**: Measure of generosity or altruism in the society.
- **Perceptions of corruption (float64)**: Public perceptions regarding corruption.
- **Positive affect (float64)**: Level of positive emotions experienced.
- **Negative affect (float64)**: Level of negative emotions experienced.

#### 2. Exploratory Analysis
The exploratory analysis highlighted several data quality issues:
- **Missing Values**: Multiple variables have missing data, with "Generosity" having the highest count of 81 missing values. Other variables like "Freedom to make life choices" and "Perceptions of corruption" also show significant missing data.
- **Outliers**: No explicit outlier detection was mentioned, but the variability in the "Life Ladder" and "Log GDP per capita" could indicate potential outliers, especially given their defined ranges.
- **Duplicates**: The data was checked and confirmed to have no duplicates.

Methods used for analysis included descriptive statistics for summary, visualizations (not included in detail here, but potential tools could be histograms and scatter plots), and correlation matrices to assess relationships between numeric variables.

#### 3. Feature Relationships
Correlation analysis reveals interesting patterns:
- **Positive Correlation**: There is a strong positive correlation between "Life Ladder" and "Log GDP per capita" (suggesting that wealthier nations tend to report higher life satisfaction).
- **Social Support**: A notable relationship between "Social support" and "Life Ladder," implying that countries with stronger social networks tend to have higher happiness ratings.
- **Negative Correlation**: There is a moderate negative correlation between "Perceptions of corruption" and "Life Ladder," hinting that higher corruption perceptions are linked to lower life satisfaction.

#### 4. Key Insights
- The average "Life Ladder" score across the data spans from 1.281 to 8.019, with a mean of 5.48.
- Countries with higher GDP per capita often report better life satisfaction levels, pointing to economic conditions as a significant driver.
- The correlation between "Healthy life expectancy at birth" and "Life Ladder" indicates health as another crucial factor affecting well-being.
- Variability in 'Generosity' and its lower mean suggests social dynamics affecting happiness are complex.

#### 5. Implications
The findings underscore a pressing need for policymakers to consider both economic and social measures in driving national happiness. Enhancing access to social services, health care, and fostering community could yield positive outcomes. Future research might focus on addressing missing data issues to ensure accuracy in insights.

**Recommendations**:
- Improve data collection methods to minimize missing values.
- Further investigate the outliers to understand their context and implications.
- Conduct comprehensive analyses to encompass broader measures of happiness beyond economic indicators.

#### 6. Visualizations
**[To include relevant charts]**:
- Correlation matrix heatmap of key variables to visualize relationships.
- Time series plots to show trends in "Life Ladder" over the years across different regions.
- Bar charts comparing average "Life Ladder" scores by country group (e.g., high-income vs. low-income).

These visualizations will not only highlight trends and correlations but will also support the narrative in understanding how various factors contribute to national happiness.

#### 7. Hypotheses
Based on the analysis, several hypotheses could be proposed for further examination:
- H1: Countries with higher levels of "Social support" will consistently show higher "Life Ladder" scores across various years.
- H2: Changes in "Freedom to make life choices" over time are predictive of changes in "Life Ladder" scores.
- H3: The impact of "Log GDP per capita" on "Life Ladder" diminishes when controlling for social support and healthy life expectancy.

These hypotheses provide a pathway for deeper investigation into the dynamics of happiness, illustrating the interplay between economic factors and social determinants of well-being.

### Conclusion
The dataset offers a substantial foundation for studying the interplay between various economic, social, and health metrics and well-being across different nations. The insights derived can inform both academic research and policy interventions focused on enhancing life satisfaction globally.
